VaMoLà
======

Validatore e Monitor per l'accessibilità

Vamolà is a ready installed version of [aChecker](https://github.com/aTutor/aChecker) validator with some improvements,
you don't need to install from zero but is enough to edit configuration parameters inside __include/config.inc.php__ file to match your database credentials.

This distribution comes with a SQL dump database (database.sql.bz2 file), it will builds **VamolaValidator** database for you from scratch.

That's because most of the customization comes from the database.

So, using Vamola you get all the <a href="https://github.com/atutor/AChecker" title="AChecker Project on Github">aChecker features, plus:

* A new guideline called "Allegato A L. 4/04" (matching Italian laws on accessibility since 20/03/2013), the latest version of "STANCA ACT"
* Full Italian language translations
* Original Vamolà HTML5 accessible theme using jQuery UI (v. 1.8.7)
