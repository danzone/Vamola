VaMoLà
======

Validatore e Monitor per l'accessibilità

This is a ready installed version of [aChecker](https://github.com/aTutor/aChecker) validator with some improvements,
you don't need to install from zero but is enough to edit configuration included into __include/config.inc.php__ to match RDMS.


This custom installation got all the aChecker features, plus:

* New Guideline called "Allegato A L. 4/04" (relative to Italian laws since 20/03/2013),
* Full Italian language translation
* Original Vamolà HTML5 theme with jQuery UI integration (v. 1.8.7)
